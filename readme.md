# Surviving the Titanic- Machine Learning fromÂ Disaster

This code loads the Titanic dataset, removes irrelevant columns, handles missing values, corrects errors and inconsistencies, converts categorical variables, normalizes numerical variables, removes outliers, and validates the cleaned data. Gradient Boosting, a popular machine learning algorithm, is then applied to predict the survival of passengers.
The data is loaded from two CSV files into Pandas DataFrames. The irrelevant columns are removed using the drop() method. Missing values in the 'Age' column are replaced with the mean age of the passengers using the fillna() method. The 'Sex' column is converted to binary values using the replace() method. Categorical variables are converted to dummy variables using the get_dummies() method. Numerical variables are normalized using the MinMaxScaler() method. Outliers are removed from the 'Fare' column using numpy.abs(), the mean, and standard deviation. Finally, the cleaned data is validated using the describe() method and column names are printed to the console. The GradientBoostingClassifier() function from the scikit-learn library is used to build a model and predict the survival of passengers based on their features.
